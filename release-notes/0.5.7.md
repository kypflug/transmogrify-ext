# Transmogrifier Extension 0.5.7

## Added

- Blocked-source warning badge in Library list rows for fallback-saved items.
- Blocked-source warning banner in standalone Viewer with a direct “Open original URL” link.

## Changed

- Preserved `rssFallbackReason` across cloud metadata + local storage models so blocked-source status survives sync/download.

## Fixed

- Deterministic renderer cleanup now strips more scraped site-chrome detritus.
- Markdown image parsing now supports trailing captions after image URLs, improving Fast output fidelity.

## Compatibility

- Core dependency remains at `@kypflug/transmogrifier-core@^0.1.26` (latest currently used in consumers).

## Validation

- `npm run build` passes.
