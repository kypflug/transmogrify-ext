# Changelog

All notable changes to Transmogrifier will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Stable extension ID** — Manifest `key` field pins the extension ID across devices, so the OAuth redirect URI is consistent without re-registering in Azure AD
- **Cloud-only articles in Library** — Library now uses `getMergedArticleList()` to show articles that exist in OneDrive but haven't been downloaded locally, with a ☁ cloud badge; clicking a cloud-only article downloads it on demand via `SYNC_DOWNLOAD_ARTICLE`
- **Sign-out button** — Sync bar in Library now shows a sign-out button when signed in

### Fixed
- **OAuth SPA redirect handling** — Added `response_mode=query` to the auth URL and fragment-fallback parsing, fixing sign-in failures when the redirect URI is registered as a Single-page application in Azure AD

## [0.4.5] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Multi-provider AI support** — The extension now supports four AI providers, selected at build time via `VITE_AI_PROVIDER`:
  - **Azure OpenAI** (default, backwards-compatible)
  - **OpenAI** (direct API)
  - **Anthropic** (Claude)
  - **Google** (Gemini)
- **Multi-provider image generation** — Image generation now supports OpenAI direct and Google Gemini (Nano Banana) in addition to Azure OpenAI, via `VITE_IMAGE_PROVIDER`
- **`getProviderName()`** helper for human-readable provider display in error messages and logs
- **Provider-specific adapters** in `ai-service.ts` — `callAzureOpenAI`, `callOpenAI`, `callAnthropic`, `callGoogle` each handle URL construction, auth headers, request format, and response parsing

### Changed
- **`config.ts` rewritten** — Monolithic `AIConfig`/`ImageConfig` interfaces replaced with discriminated union types (`AzureOpenAIConfig | OpenAIConfig | AnthropicConfig | GoogleConfig`) for type-safe provider switching
- **`ai-service.ts` refactored** — Provider-specific logic extracted from `analyzeWithAI()` into separate adapter functions; shared `parseOpenAIResponse()` for Azure OpenAI and OpenAI direct
- **`image-service.ts` refactored** — `generateSingleImage()` now dispatches to `generateAzureImage()`, `generateOpenAIImage()`, or `generateGoogleImage()` based on active provider
- **`.env.example` expanded** — Full multi-provider template with all four text providers and both image providers
- **README.md** — New multi-provider feature bullet, expanded prerequisites with provider links, per-provider `.env` configuration examples, image generation provider docs
- **claude.md** — Updated architecture diagram, file descriptions, env config section, and API notes
- **copilot-instructions.md** — Updated tech stack and description

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Sync reconciliation** — `pullFromCloud` now detects local articles missing from the cloud index and pushes them automatically, self-healing any articles whose initial push failed silently

### Fixed
- **Critical: Article ID preservation on sync** — `saveOrUpdateArticle` no longer generates a new ID when pulling remote articles; added `upsertArticle()` to `storage-service.ts` using `store.put()` to preserve original IDs, timestamps, and favorite state. This was the root cause of duplicate articles appearing across devices.
- **Cloud index drift** — Push operations (`pushArticleToCloud`, `pushMetaUpdateToCloud`) no longer manually update the cloud index; it is now rebuilt exclusively from pull/delta results, preventing index-vs-reality divergence.
- **`$filter=endswith()` on consumer OneDrive** — Removed unsupported OData `$filter` from `listRemoteArticles`; now uses client-side `.endsWith('.json')` filtering with `$top=200` pagination.
- **Inflated pull counter** — Cloud-index-only additions (no HTML downloaded) no longer increment the `pulled` count or trigger spurious `ARTICLES_CHANGED` broadcasts.
- **Favorite toggle on cloud-only articles** — `TOGGLE_FAVORITE` handler now falls back to `toggleCloudFavorite()`, which downloads the article first, then toggles and pushes the update.

### Changed
- **Sync alarm interval** reduced from 15 minutes to 5 minutes for faster cross-device convergence.
- **Delta API optimization** — `getDelta()` now uses `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` from delta responses when available, avoiding an extra Graph API call per metadata file.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Live Library updates** — Library page automatically picks up new articles without requiring a page refresh
  - Service worker broadcasts `ARTICLES_CHANGED` after remix, respin, delete, and sync pull
  - Library listens for broadcast and reloads article list
- **In-progress transmogrifications in Library** — Active remixes appear in the sidebar with live status
  - Pending items shown at top of sidebar list with spinner and status label
  - Clicking a pending item shows a progress reading pane with title, recipe, step, elapsed time, and cancel button
  - Automatically transitions to the completed article when generation finishes
  - Polls `chrome.storage.local` every 2s for reliable cross-context state sync
- **Content script re-injection** — After extension reload, content scripts are automatically re-injected on demand
  - Catches orphaned content script errors and re-injects JS/CSS from runtime manifest
  - Eliminates the need to refresh target pages after reloading the extension
- **Keyboard shortcuts for article skimming** — `j`/`k` (or ↑/↓) now select and open the next/previous article instantly; `f` toggles favorite; `Delete` prompts deletion
  - After deleting, the next article is automatically selected (or previous if at end of list)
- **Shortcut legend** — Floating keyboard shortcut reference in the bottom-right corner of the Library

### Changed
- **Popup buttons split** — Single "Transmogrify → New Tab" button replaced with two options:
  - **✨ Transmogrify & Read** (primary) — Starts the job and opens the Library to watch progress
  - **📥 Send to Library** (secondary) — Starts the job silently for "read later"; no navigation
  - Both options dismiss the popup immediately
- **Fire-and-forget remix** — `AI_ANALYZE` handler returns immediately so the popup can close; remix runs in background
- Completed transmogrifications no longer auto-open a viewer tab; articles land in the Library
- **Save FAB hidden in Library** — The floating save button injected by the meta prompt is hidden when viewing articles in the Library iframe (redundant with the header save button)

### Fixed
- Content extraction failing with "Could not establish connection" after extension reload/update

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Content extraction overhaul** — 27 CMS-specific selectors in `findMainContent()` covering WordPress, Future plc, Vox Media, Medium, Substack, and generic attribute patterns like `[itemprop="articleBody"]` and `[class*="article-body"]`
  - Div/section/span-as-paragraph fallback for CMS systems that don't use `<p>` tags
- **Tab restoration on reload** — `restoreViewerTabs()` refreshes invalidated viewer/library tabs when the extension updates

### Fixed
- **Extraction performance** — Removed `getComputedStyle()` from the DOM walk; replaced with cheap tag/class/id/attribute checks; fixes multi-second stalls on heavy pages
- **SVGAnimatedString guard** — Check on `el.className` prevents crashes on pages with inline SVGs

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- Extension badge text now uses ASCII labels (`AI`, `IMG`, `OK`, etc.) instead of emoji that rendered as corrupted glyphs
- Improved content extraction to filter out more site UI debris (topic/follow widgets, digest prompts, ARIA-role navigation elements)
- AI prompt updated to discard obvious website chrome (nav links, "Follow" buttons, "See All" links, etc.) from generated output

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-08
